# HWTBench (Hamburg Wheel Tracking on Asphalt Samples Dataset for ML Benchmarking)

## Description: 📝
The HWTBench dataset is a comprehensive collection of asphalt samples tested using the Hamburg Wheel Machine (HWM) across multiple load stages. This dataset has been meticulously generated and curated for benchmarking machine learning applications in asphalt analysis and characterization.

The Hamburg Wheel Machine (HWM) is a well-established testing device specifically designed to simulate the effects of traffic loads on asphalt materials. It applies cyclic loads and wheel abrasion to assess the performance and durability of asphalt samples under various conditions. The dataset contains a wide range of asphalt specimens that have experienced rigorous testing on the HWM, providing diverse scenarios for machine learning evaluation.

The HWTBench dataset offers a valuable resource for researchers, engineers, and data scientists working on machine-learning models for asphalt performance prediction and material analysis. This dataset allows users to develop and validate novel algorithms, models, and asphalt quality assessment and prediction techniques.
